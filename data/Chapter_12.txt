Chapter 12: Facing Another Fear
Although Mia had overcome her fear of the slide, there was still one challenge she hadn’t faced yet—speaking in front of the class. The idea of standing in front of everyone and talking made her heart race with nervousness.
When Mrs. Andrews announced that they would have to give presentations on their science fair projects, Mia felt the familiar flutter of anxiety in her chest. “I don’t think I can do it,” she whispered to Lily.
Lily squeezed her hand. “Yes, you can. You’ve already done so many brave things. This is just another one.”
Mia took a deep breath. Lily was right—she had faced her fear of heights, so she could face this too. It was all about using her willpower to push through the fear.
On the day of the presentations, Mia stood at the front of the classroom, her palms sweaty and her heart pounding. But instead of letting the fear overwhelm her, she remembered her mindfulness lesson. She focused on her breathing and reminded herself that it was okay to feel nervous.
“Hi, everyone,” Mia began, her voice a little shaky. “My project is about emotional intelligence—how understanding our own feelings and the feelings of others can help us be better friends and classmates.”
As she continued speaking, she realized that the more she talked, the more her fear faded. By the time she finished, she was smiling.
Her classmates clapped, and Mrs. Andrews gave her a big thumbs-up. “Great job, Mia! That was a wonderful presentation.”
Mia sat down, feeling proud. She had done it—she had faced another fear, and it felt amazing.
