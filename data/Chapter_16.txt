Chapter 16: The Art of Communication
One afternoon, as the group sat in the library working on their project, they hit a roadblock. Max wanted the project to be about technology, while Mia thought it would be better to focus on nature. Sam didn’t care either way, but Tara had a completely different idea—she wanted to focus on art.
“We’re not getting anywhere,” Max grumbled. “If we don’t decide soon, we won’t have time to finish.”
Mia knew this was a classic example of role conflict. Each person had their own idea of what the project should be, and they weren’t finding common ground. “Maybe we need to take a step back and talk about why each of us wants to do our topic,” she suggested. “That way, we can understand each other’s perspectives.”
This was a key part of effective communication—listening to everyone’s viewpoint before making a decision. Max sighed but agreed. Tara spoke first. “I think art is important because it helps people express themselves and understand their emotions. It’s like how we use creativity to solve problems.”
Sam nodded. “That makes sense. But technology is cool too because it’s what drives innovation. Without it, we wouldn’t have all the gadgets and tools we use every day.”
Mia added her thoughts about nature. “I think nature teaches us a lot about balance. Like, just how trees and plants depend on each other, people also need to take care of each other. It’s about interconnectedness.”
Max listened to everyone’s ideas and thought about it. Finally, he said, “What if we combine all three? We could make the project about how technology, nature, and art are all connected in the way they help people and the world.”
Everyone agreed. It was the perfect compromise, and they had arrived at a solution by using negotiation and persuasion. Mia was proud of how they had solved the problem together.
