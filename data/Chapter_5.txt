Chapter 5: The Science Fair Idea
Later that week, the school announced that there would be a science fair. Max’s mind immediately filled with ideas. He loved building things and had a passion for science. But Mia, who was more interested in books, wasn’t sure what she could do for the fair.
That night at home, the twins sat at the kitchen table, brainstorming ideas. “I’m thinking of building a robot!” Max said, eyes shining with excitement. “It’ll be awesome!”
Mia tapped her pencil against her notebook. “I’m not sure what to do. I want to create something meaningful, but I don’t have any ideas.”
Their dad walked by and smiled at Mia. “Sometimes, the best ideas come from things we already care about,” he said. “What’s something you’ve been thinking about a lot lately?”
Mia thought about it. “Well, I’ve been learning a lot about emotions and how people can handle stress. Maybe I could make something about that?”
Her dad nodded. “That sounds like emotional intelligence—knowing how to handle your own feelings and understanding others'. That’s a great idea for a project!”
Mia smiled. She didn’t know what her project would look like yet, but she was excited to learn more about how people think and feel.
