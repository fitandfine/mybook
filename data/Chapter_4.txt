Chapter 4: Facing Fear
As the week went by, Mia began to settle in more at her new school, and her fear of not fitting in started to fade. But there was one thing she still avoided—the playground’s tall, twisty slide. Mia had always had a phobia of heights, and just looking at the slide made her knees shake.
One day, Lily asked her, “Why don’t you ever go on the slide with the rest of us?”
Mia felt a bit embarrassed. “I... I’m scared of heights,” she admitted quietly.
Lily nodded. “That’s okay. I used to be scared of the dark, but I got over it. My mom says fear is just a feeling, and feelings can change.”
Mia knew Lily was right. Maybe her fear of heights was something she could work on. Her mom always told her about something called systematic desensitization, a fancy word for slowly facing your fears, bit by bit.
That afternoon, Mia decided to try something new. She stood at the bottom of the slide and watched as the other kids zoomed down. Her heart raced, but she didn’t back away. Instead, she put one foot on the slide’s ladder, then another. She climbed slowly, and before she knew it, she was at the top.
Max spotted her from the soccer field. “Go, Mia!” he cheered. “You’ve got this!”
With trembling hands, Mia sat down on the slide, took a deep breath, and pushed herself forward. In an instant, she was sliding down, the wind rushing past her face. When she reached the bottom, she was laughing and felt a sense of achievement.
“I did it!” Mia shouted.
“You sure did,” Lily said, smiling. “And now you know that fear doesn’t have to stop you from having fun.”
Mia felt proud of herself. She had faced her fear and learned something new about courage. Sometimes, she thought, bravery was just doing the thing that scared you, one small step at a time.
