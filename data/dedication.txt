To the greatest educators I've been blessed with,
To Chhabi Ram Chapain, Laxmi Nand Dhakal and Dr. Arun Kumar.
Thank you for never imposing any intellectual authority on me.
Thank you for kindling the spark of creativity, critical thinking and problem solving in me. 
Thank you for letting me see your thought process and also the work in progress. 
You three are the exclusive members of the club towards which my brain will always owe everything.
This book is my tribute to your trust on me.
With love.
