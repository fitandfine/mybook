Chapter 2: The First Day
When Mia and Max arrived at school, the noise of kids talking and laughing filled the air. Max immediately ran off to join a group of boys who were playing soccer. Mia, on the other hand, stood to the side, feeling unsure. She didn’t want to jump into something too quickly. Instead, she decided to observe how everyone behaved, a skill she had developed from her introverted nature.
After a while, Mia noticed a girl sitting alone on a bench, reading a book. She gathered her courage and walked over. “Hi, I’m Mia,” she said with a small smile.
The girl looked up and smiled back. “Hi, I’m Lily.”
Mia felt a little more at ease. Maybe starting at this new school wouldn’t be so bad after all. She sat down beside Lily and noticed that they were reading the same book! “I love that book,” Mia said.
“Me too,” Lily replied. “I love books that make me think. They make me feel like I’m learning something new every time.”
“That’s called cognition,” Mia said. “It’s the way we learn and understand things.”
Lily grinned. “You’re smart! Maybe we can read together at lunch?”
Mia nodded happily. Making a new friend was much easier than she had expected.
