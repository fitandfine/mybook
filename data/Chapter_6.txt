Chapter 6: The Experiment Begins
For her project, Mia decided to create an experiment about empathy and emotional regulation. She wanted to show how important it was to be kind and understand how others felt.
Max, meanwhile, was busy working on his robot, but he couldn’t help but notice how focused Mia was. “What are you doing?” he asked one evening.
“I’m thinking about how people can be better friends by understanding emotions,” Mia said. “I think if people learn about mindfulness and empathy, they can have healthier relationships.”
Max scratched his head. “That sounds complicated.”
Mia grinned. “It’s not really. It’s like how you’re always there for me when I’m scared or sad. You understand how I feel, and that’s empathy.”
Max nodded. “I get it. So, what’s your plan?”
“I’m going to give people different scenarios and see how they respond,” Mia explained. “Like, how they would feel if they saw someone being left out or how they would help someone who was sad.”
Max thought it was a cool idea. “I think you’re onto something, Mia.”
