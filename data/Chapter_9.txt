Chapter 9: The New Friends
After the science fair, Mia and Max had both made new friends. Mia had bonded with Lily, while Max had become closer to the boys on his soccer team. But one day, they noticed a boy named Sam sitting alone during lunch. He looked sad, and no one seemed to talk to him.
Mia, being the kind of person who noticed how others felt, turned to Max. “Do you think Sam’s okay? He seems lonely.”
Max shrugged. “Maybe he’s just shy. Not everyone’s as outgoing as me, you know.”
Mia thought for a moment. “I think we should go talk to him. He might need a friend.”
Max agreed, and together they walked over to Sam’s table. “Hey, Sam,” Mia said gently. “Do you want to sit with us?”
Sam looked up, surprised. “Uh, sure,” he said, hesitating for a second before grabbing his lunch tray and joining them.
As they ate, Mia asked Sam about his hobbies. She learned that he loved drawing and reading comics, things Mia was interested in, too. Max found out that Sam liked soccer, but he had never been brave enough to join the team.
“You should come play with us sometime,” Max said. “You don’t have to be the best; it’s just about having fun.”
Sam smiled, and Mia could see that their simple invitation had lifted his spirits. It reminded her of how important inclusion was. Everyone needs to feel like they belong somewhere.
