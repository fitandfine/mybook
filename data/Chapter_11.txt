Chapter 11: The Mindfulness Lesson
As time went on, Mia became more interested in mindfulness—a way of paying attention to your thoughts and feelings without judging them. She had read that practicing mindfulness could help people handle stress better, and she wanted to learn more.
One day, her teacher, Mrs. Andrews, announced that they would be having a mindfulness lesson in class. “Today, we’re going to learn how to be more aware of our feelings and thoughts,” she said. “Mindfulness is a great way to stay calm, even when things get stressful.”
Mia was excited. This was exactly what she had been reading about! Mrs. Andrews guided the class through a simple mindfulness exercise. “Close your eyes,” she said softly. “Focus on your breathing. Notice how the air feels as it moves in and out of your lungs.”
Mia followed along, paying attention to the gentle rise and fall of her chest. For the first time, she felt truly calm and centered. She wasn’t thinking about the past or worrying about the future—she was just focused on the present moment.
“That’s what mindfulness is all about,” Mrs. Andrews explained after the exercise. “It’s about being in the moment and not letting your thoughts control you.”
Mia realized that mindfulness could help her in so many ways. If she ever felt stressed or overwhelmed, she could use this technique to calm herself down and feel more in control.
