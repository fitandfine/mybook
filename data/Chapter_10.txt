Chapter 10: The Conflict
Everything was going great for Mia and Max until one day, something unexpected happened. Max’s soccer team got into a big argument. Two of the boys, Jake and Tom, were mad at each other because Jake had accidentally kicked the ball into Tom’s face during practice.
“It wasn’t on purpose!” Jake said, but Tom wasn’t listening. “You did it because you’re jealous that I’m better than you!”
Max could feel the tension building. He knew that this conflict could ruin their team if they didn’t resolve it soon. He remembered learning about conflict resolution—the process of solving a disagreement in a way that everyone feels heard.
“Hey, guys, calm down,” Max said, stepping between them. “We don’t want to make this worse. Let’s talk about it.”
Tom crossed his arms. “What’s there to talk about? He did it on purpose.”
Max shook his head. “You’re both great players, and fighting won’t make anyone better. Maybe it was an accident. Let’s just figure out what really happened.”
Jake nodded. “It was an accident, I swear.”
Tom sighed, finally letting go of his anger. “Okay, maybe I overreacted,” he admitted. “Sorry for yelling.”
Max smiled, glad that they had been able to solve the problem. “That’s what teamwork is all about,” he said. “We’ve got to stick together, not tear each other apart.”
Mia, who had been watching from the side, was proud of her brother. “That’s exactly how to handle a conflict,” she said. “Everyone gets a chance to say how they feel, and then you find a solution that works for everyone.”
