Chapter 13: A Lesson in Empathy
One afternoon, the class was discussing a story about a boy who had been bullied for being different. Some students felt sad for him, while others didn’t understand why he didn’t just stand up for himself.
Mrs. Andrews took this opportunity to teach them about empathy. “Empathy is about putting yourself in someone else’s shoes,” she explained. “It’s about imagining how you would feel if you were in their situation.”
Mia raised her hand. “I think empathy is really important because it helps us understand each other better. When we understand how someone feels, we can be kinder and more helpful.”
Mrs. Andrews nodded. “Exactly, Mia. Empathy is one of the most important traits we can have. It helps us build strong relationships and make the world a better place.”
Max, who had been listening quietly, spoke up. “So if I see someone being left out, I should think about how lonely they might feel and invite them to join in?”
Mrs. Andrews smiled. “That’s a perfect example of empathy, Max. Understanding someone’s feelings and taking action to help them is what empathy is all about.”
