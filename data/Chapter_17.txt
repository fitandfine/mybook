Chapter 17: The Role of Emotions
As they continued to work on the project, they hit another challenge—Sam seemed distracted, and Mia noticed he wasn’t contributing as much as usual. His engagement with the project seemed to drop, and he often seemed lost in thought.
“Is everything okay, Sam?” Mia asked him quietly one afternoon.
Sam shrugged. “I’m just feeling a little down lately. It’s like...I don’t know, I’m not interested in much anymore.”
Mia recognized the signs of emotional fatigue—when someone’s feelings become overwhelming and they start to feel tired or detached from things that used to interest them. “Do you want to talk about it?” Mia asked gently.
Sam shook his head. “Not really. I’m just not sure how to deal with everything.”
Max overheard their conversation and came over. “Hey, I get it,” he said. “Sometimes, when I feel like that, I do something to take my mind off things. Like playing soccer or building stuff. It helps me feel better.”
“That’s called distraction,” Mia said. “It’s one way people deal with stress, but it’s also important to talk about how you’re feeling. It’s called emotional validation—acknowledging your emotions is the first step to dealing with them.”
Sam thought about it and nodded slowly. “I guess you’re right. I’ve just been stressed about home stuff, and it’s been getting to me.”
Mia smiled. “We’re here for you, Sam. You don’t have to carry everything by yourself.”
