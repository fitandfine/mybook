Chapter 7: Max’s Big Build
Max couldn’t wait to finish his robot for the science fair. He loved using his hands, and building things made him feel alive. His motivation was strong, especially since he wanted to show his classmates that he could create something amazing.
But after working for hours in his room, Max started to feel frustrated again. His robot’s arm wouldn’t move the way he wanted it to. “Ugh!” he groaned. “This thing is broken!”
Their dad walked in, smiling. “Max, it sounds like you’re hitting some obstacles,” he said, patting Max on the back. “That’s normal in any big project. What’s important is how you handle the setbacks. It’s all part of problem-solving.”
Max sighed and looked at the robot. “But I feel like I’m not getting anywhere.”
“Let’s try cognitive restructuring,” his dad suggested. “Instead of thinking ‘I’m not getting anywhere,’ try telling yourself ‘I’m learning how to fix this.’ Sometimes, just changing how we talk to ourselves can help us see things in a new way.”
Max thought about it and nodded. “Okay, I’ll try.” He took a deep breath and looked at the problem differently. “Maybe if I adjust the arm’s gears, it’ll work better.”
After a few more tries, the robot’s arm finally moved! Max grinned. His dad was right—changing how he thought about the problem helped him fix it.
“That’s better!” Max said with a big smile. He felt proud of himself for sticking with it. His self-efficacy—the belief in his ability to succeed—was growing stronger every day.
