
Dear Parents,

I am excited to share with you a resource that is close to my heart and comes with no strings attached.

THIS RESOURCE IS:
ABSOLUTELY FREE – No cost, now or ever.
FOR FOREVER – It will always be available for you.
FOR EVERYONE – Share it freely with anyone who might benefit.
WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY – Feel free to use it as you wish for your child’s growth.
This is my humble gift to your child, just as it is for mine. I believe every child deserves the words to express their feelings and navigate their emotional world with clarity. When children can’t express themselves, they are left vulnerable to misunderstanding and hurt. My goal with this project is to give our kids the vocabulary they need to voice their emotions and communicate effectively, ensuring they grow into mentally and emotionally healthy individuals.

I created this story as a way for my daughter to learn emotional intelligence, not through dull word lists, but by putting those words into context. I hope this approach resonates with your children as well.

You can download and even share this book in its exact form. It’s my effort to build something meaningful for the future of our children, and as I continue to improve this project based on feedback, I welcome any thoughts you may have.

If you feel inclined to support me in this journey, you’re welcome to buy me a coffee. Your support would mean a lot, but your kindness and encouragement are just as valuable.

Together, let's let the brilliance within our children shine.

Wishing you joyful parenting,

With love,
Anup
