Dear Parents,
This is an effort from a father to introduce his daughter to the vocabulary pertaining to psychology.
Story is just here to string words together. The vocabulary list is here in the website itself. I will keep upgrading things here.
If you want to support me, you can buy me a coffee. Ask for my paypal. or you can absolutely use these resources for free, for forever.
Let the star inside our kids see the light of the day.
Happy Parenting.
