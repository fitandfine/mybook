This is an effort from a father to introduce his daughter to the vocabulary pertaining to psychology. When our children cannot express what they are going through emotionally, it's a disasterous recipe to nurturing a broken human being with undeserved traumas. I want to give children thwir much-deserved voice to communicate their emotions precisely to get the help they need to feel emotionally safe and grow up to be a mentally and physically healthy human beings who know how to operate in this society with fellow human beings.
This story is just here to string words together. I don't expect my daughter to go through 300 word list of emotional intelligence without any context. It's plainly boring. I would have not studied raw word list alone. Also, context help them unserdtand the usage as well.
The vocabulary list is here in the website itself. I will keep upgrading things here as my daughter gives feedback about her experience and her needs. You can also give me feedback, if I can implement, i will try it for sure. 
Good for our kids. 
If you want to support me, you can buy me a coffee.
Let the star inside our kids see the light of the day.
Happy Parenting.
With Love,
