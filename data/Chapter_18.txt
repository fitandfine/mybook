Chapter 18: Self-Control and Patience
A few days later, Max found himself struggling with self-control. He was in the middle of another soccer game, and his team wasn’t doing well. He hated losing, and the frustration was building inside him like a volcano. Every time someone on the other team scored, Max’s temper flared a little more.
By the time the final whistle blew, Max was ready to explode. His team had lost, and he was mad—at the other team, at his teammates, and at himself.
As Max stormed off the field, Mia ran up to him. “Hey, Max, take a breath,” she said. “You’re letting your emotions control you.”
Max glared at the ground. “I hate losing.”
“I know, but you’re not going to feel better by staying mad,” Mia said. “Remember what Mrs. Andrews taught us about emotional regulation? It’s about learning to manage your feelings instead of letting them manage you.”
Max took a deep breath, trying to calm down. “I just...I really wanted to win.”
“Winning isn’t everything,” Mia said gently. “Sometimes, it’s more about how you handle the loss. It’s called resilience—bouncing back after things don’t go your way.”
Max nodded slowly. “I guess I need to work on that.”
Mia smiled. “We all do. But you’re already better at it than you think.”
