Chapter 14: The Power of Friendship
As the school year progressed, Mia, Max, and their new friend Sam grew closer. They often sat together at lunch, shared stories, and played games after school. For the first time, Sam felt like he truly belonged. But there was one thing that kept nagging at Mia—Sam never spoke about his family.
One day, during lunch, Mia gently asked, “Sam, you never talk about your parents. Is everything okay?”
Sam hesitated, fidgeting with his sandwich. “My mom works a lot, and my dad...well, he’s not around,” Sam said, his voice quiet. “It’s just me and my little sister most of the time.”
Mia and Max exchanged glances. They didn’t know what to say, but they didn’t want Sam to feel like he had to hide his feelings. Empathy kicked in for Mia—she knew what it felt like to feel alone, even if her experience was different from Sam’s.
“That sounds really tough,” Mia said softly. “But we’re your friends, and we’re here for you.”
Sam gave them a small smile. “Thanks. Sometimes I feel like no one really gets it. But it helps knowing I have friends like you.”
This was a turning point in their friendship. Max had learned about emotional vulnerability—when someone opens up about their feelings, it takes a lot of courage, and it strengthens the bond between people. Mia, meanwhile, realized that friendship wasn’t just about having fun together; it was also about support and understanding.
