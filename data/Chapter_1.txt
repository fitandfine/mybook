Chapter 1: The New School
Mia and Max were twins, and though they looked alike, their personalities couldn’t have been more different. Mia was introverted, preferring quiet days with her books, while Max was the extrovert of the pair, always looking for new friends and adventures. They were about to start at a new school, which filled Mia with anxiety. Max, on the other hand, was filled with enthusiasm and couldn’t wait to meet everyone.
"Don't worry, Mia," Max said, noticing the worried look on his sister's face. "You just need a bit of self-confidence. It's all about having a good attitude."
Mia tried to smile, but her nervousness made her feel like there were butterflies in her stomach. "I know, Max, but what if I don’t fit in? What if they don’t like me?"
Max shrugged. "That’s just your fear talking. Emotions can sometimes make us think things that aren't true."
Mia nodded but still felt unsure. She knew Max was right, but she couldn't shake her worries. What if something went wrong?
Their mom walked into the room with two lunchboxes. “Remember, starting at a new school is a big change,” she said. “It’s normal to feel a little bit of stress, Mia, but soon you’ll adapt.”
Mia knew that her mom was right. Change could be hard, but she’d cope. She had to.
