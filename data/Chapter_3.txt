Chapter 3: Max’s Challenge
While Mia was finding her place, Max was having a different kind of day. He loved meeting new people, but sometimes his competitiveness could get the better of him. During the soccer game, Max was trying hard to score, but no matter how many times he kicked the ball, he kept missing. His frustration was growing. "Come on, Max!" one of the boys shouted. "You’ve got to try harder!"
Max gritted his teeth. He didn't like making mistakes in front of others. He was feeling the pressure of the social norms—he wanted to fit in and do well.
Suddenly, he remembered what his mom had told him about perseverance. “You just need to keep trying, no matter how many times you fail,” she had said. "That’s how you build resilience."
So Max took a deep breath, kicked the ball again, and this time, it soared right into the goal. The boys cheered, and Max’s self-esteem soared. He felt proud of himself for not giving up.
“That’s called grit,” he thought, remembering another one of his mom’s lessons. Grit was the ability to keep going, even when things were tough.
