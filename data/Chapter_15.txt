Chapter 15: The Group Project Challenge
As the school year continued, Mrs. Andrews announced a new group project that the students would be working on for the next two weeks. “You’ll be working in groups of four,” she said. “This will help you learn the importance of collaboration and how to combine different strengths to achieve a common goal.”
Max was excited. He loved group projects because they gave him a chance to show off his leadership skills. Mia, on the other hand, wasn’t as thrilled. She liked working by herself because she could think deeply about things without having to worry about everyone else’s ideas.
Their group included Sam and a girl named Tara, who was very quiet and rarely spoke in class. Right away, Max started organizing their tasks. “I’ll handle the building part, of course,” he said confidently. “Sam, you can help me, and Mia, you can write everything up.”
Tara raised her hand shyly. “I...I’d like to help too,” she said in a small voice.
Max hadn’t expected that, and for a moment, he didn’t know what to say. He liked being in charge, but he also didn’t want to exclude anyone. Mia stepped in. “Tara, you can definitely help,” she said. “What part of the project would you like to work on?”
Tara hesitated before saying, “I’m good at drawing. Maybe I could help design the presentation?”
Max nodded. “That works! We’ll all have a role.”
As they worked together over the next few days, Max learned a valuable lesson about delegation and fairness. It wasn’t just about him doing the important parts—everyone’s contribution mattered, and by letting everyone have a say, the project was stronger. Mia realized that group dynamics could be tricky, but they were also a great opportunity to learn how to communicate and compromise.
