Chapter 8: The Science Fair Test
On the day of the science fair, the gym was buzzing with excitement. Max had his robot set up, and Mia had her empathy experiment ready. The other students walked around, checking out the projects. Some were building volcanoes, others had posters on space exploration, but Mia’s project was all about emotional intelligence.
She invited her classmates to participate in a small test. “I’m going to show you different pictures of people, and I want you to tell me how you think they’re feeling,” she explained.
The first picture was of a little boy crying. “What do you think he’s feeling?” Mia asked.
“Sad!” one of the students answered.
“Right,” Mia said. “Now, how would you help him?”
“I’d give him a hug and ask what’s wrong,” the student said.
Mia smiled. “That’s empathy—understanding how someone feels and wanting to help them.” She felt proud that her experiment was working. People were really thinking about their emotions and how they could connect with others.
Meanwhile, Max was showing off his robot to a group of kids. “Check this out!” he said as the robot rolled forward, its arms moving up and down. The kids clapped and cheered, impressed with his invention.
Max beamed with pride. He knew that his hard work had paid off, and now he could enjoy the positive reinforcement from his classmates.
